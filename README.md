This module contains a world generator for [Terasology](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology) which generates a snowy alpine terrain
with tall mountains with snow-caps and deep valleys with frozen lakes.

## Current features:

* Tall mountains (the maximum height of which is customizable)
* Snow caps in the higher reaches of the mountains
* Frozen lakes in the valleys
* Tons of snow mounds
